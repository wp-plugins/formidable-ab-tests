Easily A/B test your Formidable Pro created forms.

== Description == 
This plugin provides a shortcode to indicate which Formidable Pro forms to choose from, then randomly dislpays one of the forms each time the page is shown. 
Also ads an admin page to view results and determine which version is "winning" the A/B test.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `formidable-ab-test.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unzip it there, or use the WordPress Dashboard to install it.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Create your forms as usual and use the provided shortcode to randomly display forms and record views.
4. See Formidable > A/B Test in the WP admin area for more detailed instructions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I A/B test forms? =

Look for the A/B Test admin page under the Formidable tab. Here you will find simple instructions and see your results.

= How many forms can I test? =

There are no set limits. It doesn't make sense, however, to test more than two variations at a time.

= How many tests can I run? =

Currently you can only run one test at a time. It's on the drawing board to add the ability to run multiple tests concurrently. 

There is an option to clear test data on the admin page so you can start a new test.
